# cheatsheet-git
A git cheatsheet to help me remembering git commands.


## Backtrack in git
* git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
* git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
* git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.


## Git Teamwork
* git clone remote_location clone_name
* git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
* git remote -v: Lists a Git projectâ€™s remotes.
* git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
* git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
* git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
