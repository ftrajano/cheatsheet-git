# cheatsheet-git
A git cheatsheet to help me remembering git commands.


## Backtrack in git
* git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
* git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
* git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.


## Git Teamwork
* git clone remote_location clone_name
